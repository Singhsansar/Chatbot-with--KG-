The review commented, \"There’s another paradox the film hints at, too: the qualities that made it challenging for Buffett to deal with people are the very qualities that made him such a brilliant investor.\" The New Yorker observed, \"It’s also about an ability to divorce yourself from emotion, to be rational at a time when other people are acting irrationally, and to be calm when others are fearful.\"The New York Times noted the documentary told Buffett\\'s biography \"in a relatively new way\". The review commented that, though the overall portrayal of the man was positive, it also described Buffett, \"as something of a remarkable human computer, gifted with numbers and less so with interpersonal relationships.\"Money observed the film is, \"Chock full of the traditionalist eccentricities the \\'oracle of Omaha\\' is best known for–like his love of Coca Cola, and the fact that he lives in the same house he bought in 1958 for $31,500\". Money pointed out that the documentary went more in-depth than these specifics about Buffett, and \"reveals a surprising set of facts even Buffett die hards may have missed.\"According to the film critic news aggregation analysis on Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary garnered positive reviews from the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, and a negative review from Entertainment Weekly.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBecoming Warren Buffett at IMDb', metadata={'title': 'Becoming Warren Buffett', 'summary': 'Becoming Warren Buffett is a 2017 documentary film about Warren Buffett and his life.

Bono performed \"Forever Young\" and \"All I Want Is You\" at her funeral.  Warren was so grief-stricken that he did not attend.

She really wants to know their stories,\" Warren Buffett said to The Wall Street Journal.Doris Buffett also established the Learning By Giving Foundation which promotes the study of experiential philanthropy at colleges and universities across the United States. At the end of the semester, students are given real money to grant to local nonprofits in their community. Doris said the goal of Learning by Giving is to instill in students, \"the urge to do things for others all of their lives; to see the need to do something, to be an activist, to work toward social justice.\" She believed that this program will not only outlive her, but also create a ripple effect that will inspire generations to come.\\nBuffett made her home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and moved to Boston in 2016 to be closer to family, and to receive treatment for Alzheimer\\'s disease.In December 2018, Doris released a second book titled Letters to Doris: One Woman\\'s Quest to Help Those With Nowhere Else to Turn.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nBuffett died on August 4, 2020, at her home in Rockport, Maine, at the age of 92.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nWarren Buffett\\nHoward Buffett\\nPeter Buffett\\nSusan Alice Buffett\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDoris Buffett Legacy website\\nFoundation website\\nBuffett interview', metadata={'title': 'Doris Buffett', 'summary': \"Doris Eleanor Buffett (February 12, 1928 – August 4, 2020) was an American philanthropist also known as the 'retail' philanthropist and the founder of The Sunshine Lady Foundation, The Learning By Giving Foundation, and The Letters Foundation which she co-founded alongside her younger brother, billionaire Warren Buffett.

Chace, who was a carpenter, started working for Samuel Slater, the founder of the first successful textile mill in America. Chace founded his first textile mill in 1806. In 1929, the Valley Falls Company merged with the Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company established in 1889, in Adams, Massachusetts. The combined company was known as Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates.In 1955, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates merged with the Hathaway Manufacturing Company which had been founded in 1888 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, by Horatio Hathaway with profits from whaling and the China Trade. Hathaway had been successful in its first decades, but it suffered during a general decline in the textile industry after World War I. At this time, Hathaway was run by Seabury Stanton, whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the Great Depression. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120 million in revenue, and was headquartered in New Bedford. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade, accompanied by large layoffs.\\n\\n\\n=== Transformation into a conglomerate ===\\nIn 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing it was statistically undervalued. Buffett bought the stock with the idea that as Berkshire closed textile mills and freed capital, there would be a tender offer at some point and they could sell the stock for a profit. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve. In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer to buy back Buffett's stake in the company for $11.50 per share. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11.375. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry. Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did).

He was vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man. Munger served as chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation from 1984 through 2011. He was also chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation, based in Los Angeles, California, and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nCharles Thomas Munger was born on January 1, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Florence \"Toody\" (Russell) and Alfred Case Munger, a lawyer. As a teenager, he worked at Buffett & Son, a grocery store owned by Warren Buffett\\'s grandfather, Ernest P. Buffett. His grandfather, Thomas Charles Munger, was a state representative and later a U.S. district court judge appointed by Theodore Roosevelt.He enrolled in the University of Michigan, where he studied mathematics. During his time in college, he joined the fraternity Sigma Phi Society. In early 1943, a few days after his 19th birthday, he dropped out of college to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he became a second lieutenant. After receiving a high score on the Army General Classification Test, he was ordered to study meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, California, the town he was to make his home.Through the GI Bill Munger took a number of advanced courses through several universities. When he applied to his father\\'s alma mater, Harvard Law School, the dean of admissions rejected him because Munger had not completed an undergraduate degree. However, the dean relented after a call from Roscoe Pound, the former dean of Harvard Law and a Munger family friend. Munger excelled in law school, becoming a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and graduating in 1948 with a J.D., magna cum laude.In college and the Army, he developed \"an important skill\": card playing. He used this in his approach to business. \"What you have to learn is to fold early when the odds are against you, or if you have a big edge, back it heavily because you don\\'t get a big edge often. Opportunity comes, but it doesn\\'t come often, so seize it when it does come.\" He also used the card analogy to explain his approach to investing. He maintained that treating the shares of a company like baseball cards is a losing strategy because it requires one to predict the behavior of often irrational and emotional human beings.\\n\\n\\n== Investment career ==\\nMunger moved with his family to California, where he joined the law firm Wright & Garrett (later Musick, Peeler & Garrett). In 1962, he founded and worked as a real estate attorney at Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. He then gave up the practice of law to concentrate on managing investments and later partnered with Otis Booth in real estate development. When he met Buffett over lunch at the Omaha Club, the two began talking about investments and never stopped. He then partnered with Jack Wheeler to form Wheeler, Munger, and Company, an investment firm with a seat on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. He wound up Wheeler, Munger, and Co. in 1976, after losses of 32% in 1973 and 31% in 1974.Although Munger was better known for his association with Buffett, he ran an investment partnership of his own from 1962 to 1975. According to Buffett\\'s essay \"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\", published in 1984, Munger\\'s investment partnership generated compound annual returns of 19.8% during the 1962–75 period compared to a 5.0% annual appreciation rate for the Dow.Munger was previously the chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.

The list was first published in March 1987. The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt and other factors. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists. This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding any ranking of those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.In 2018, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was ranked at the top for the first time and became the first centibillionaire included in the ranking, surpassing Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who had topped the list 18 of the previous 24 years. In 2022, after topping the list for four years, Bezos was surpassed by Elon Musk. In 2023, Musk was in turn surpassed by French businessman Bernard Arnault, after topping the list for just a year. Arnault became the first French person to top the list.\\n\\n\\n== Methodology ==\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world\\'s wealthiest individuals and sometimes groups or families – who share wealth. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses – some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions. Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets – land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc. – are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual\\'s holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual\\'s estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual\\'s true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.When a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members it is included under a single listing (as a single \"family fortune\") provided that individual (the grantor) is still living. However, if a deceased billionaire\\'s fortune has been dispersed, it will not appear as a single listing, and each recipient will only appear if his or her own total net worth is over a $1 billion (his or her net worth will not be combined with family members\\'). Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.\\n\\n\\n== Annual rankings ==\\n\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worths listed are snapshots taken at that time.

When this method was unsuccessful, he turned to a strategy very similar to what would later be described as value investing. In 2017, Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments wrote:\\n\\nInstead of using big-picture economics, Keynes increasingly focused on a small number of companies that he knew very well. Rather than chasing momentum, he bought undervalued stocks with generous dividends. [...] Most were small and midsize companies in dull or out of favor industries, such as mining and autos in the midst of the Great Depression. Despite his rough start [by timing markets], Keynes beat the market averages by 6 percent a year over more than two decades.Keynes used many similar terms and concepts as Graham and Dodd (e.g. an emphasis on the intrinsic value of equities). But a review of his archives at King\\'s College found no evidence of contact between Keynes and his American counterparts so he is believed to have developed his investing theories independently, and did not teach his concepts in classes or seminars as did Graham and Dodd. While Keynes was long recognized as a superior investor, the full details of his investing theories were not widely known until decades after his 1946 death. Furthermore, while there was \"considerable overlap\" of Keynes\\'s ideas with those of Graham and Dodd, their respective ideas were not entirely congruent.\\n\\n\\n=== Benjamin Graham ===\\nValue investing was established by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, both professors at Columbia Business School and teachers of many famous investors.

The family moved to East Vancouver, British Columbia when Pattison was six years old, but he returned to Saskatchewan during summers.His first summer job was playing trumpet at a children\\'s church camp and later picking fruit (raspberries, cherries, and peaches) during the summer while in high school. Pattison had many jobs while in high school, including selling doughnuts in the school parking lot, selling seeds door-to-door, delivering newspapers, and working as a page boy at the Georgia Hotel. He graduated from John Oliver Secondary School in 1947.After high school, he worked in a cannery, a packing house, as a labourer building bridges in the mountains, and then for the Canadian Pacific Railway as a dining car attendant before accepting a job washing cars at a gas station with a small attached used-car lot. By chance, while the regular salesman was away, Pattison sold one of the cars on the lot and found his profession. He parlayed that success into a job selling used cars during the summer at one of the largest used-car lots in Vancouver, using his earnings to pay for his studies at the University of British Columbia (although he did not complete his studies, being three classes short of a business degree).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nDuring a break from University in summer 1948, Pattison was selling cars at Richmond Motors in BC, although his primary duty was washing cars.

Buffett\\'s parents were second cousins, both having mainly English descent. The Buffet surname (changed to Buffett) originates in France with a Huguenot weaver, named John Buffett, who became Buffett\\'s first American Buffett ancestor when he immigrated to New York in the late 1600s.Buffett attended Omaha High School.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nAfter graduation from high school, he worked at his father\\'s \"Buffett & Son\" grocery from 1895 to 1915, becoming the owner and operator of its new downtown branch location in 1915. He employed his grandson Warren at the grocery store when he was in high school.Buffett gained local and national recognition for his innovation in the grocery industry for the first decades of the 20th century. He founded a retail cooperative organization known as \"Buy-Rite\" which allowed smaller, family-owned grocers to compete with the larger chain supermarkets and stores through cooperative purchasing and advertising.In 1902, Buffett became the president of the Omaha Retail Grocers Association and later was the president of the Nebraska Retail Grocers Association. He also was an active member of the National Retail Grocers Association. Buffett was a member of the local chamber of commerce, rotary club, Boy Scouts of America council, and served for a period as president of the Nebraska Humane Society.Buffett was an astute businessman who was known to be frugal, strict, and conservative. In 1939, he wrote, \"there has never been a Buffett who ever left a very large estate, but there has never been one that did not leave something.

       " Document(page_content='The Buffett indicator (or the Buffett metric, or the Market capitalization-to-GDP ratio) is a valuation multiple used to assess how expensive or cheap the aggregate stock market is at a given point in time.  It was proposed as a metric by investor Warren Buffett in 2001, who called it \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\", and its modern form compares the capitalization of the US Wilshire 5000 index to US GDP.  It is widely followed by the financial media as a valuation measure for the US market in both its absolute, and de-trended forms.The indicator set an all-time high during the so-called \"everything bubble\", crossing the 200% level in February 2021; a level that Buffett warned if crossed, was \"playing with fire\".\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nOn 10 December 2001, Buffett proposed the metric in a Fortune essay co-authored with journalist Carol Loomis.  In the essay, Buffett presented a chart going back 80 years that showed the value of all \"publicly traded securities\" in the US as a percentage of \"US GNP\".  Buffett said of the metric: \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. And as you can see, nearly two years ago the ratio rose to an unprecedented level. That should have been a very strong warning signal\".Buffett explained that for the annual return of US securities to materially exceed the annual growth of US GNP for a protracted period of time: \"you need to have the line go straight off the top of the chart. That won\\'t happen\".  Buffett finished the essay by outlining the levels he believed the metric showed favorable or poor times to invest: \"For me, the message of that chart is this: If the percentage relationship falls to the 70% or 80% area, buying stocks is likely to work very well for you. If the ratio approaches 200%–as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000–you are playing with fire\".Buffett\\'s metric became known as the \"Buffett Indicator\", and has continued to receive widespread attention in the financial media, and in modern finance textbooks.In 2018, finance author Mark Hulbert writing in the Wall Street Journal, listed the Buffett indicator as one of his \"Eight Best Predictors of the Long-Term Market\".A study by two European academics published in May, 2022 found the Buffett Indicator \"explains a large fraction of ten-year return variation for the majority of countries outside the United States\". The study examined 10-year periods in fourteen developed markets, in most cases with data starting in 1973. The Buffett Indicator forecasted an average of 83% of returns across all nations and periods, though the predictive value ranged from a low of 42% to as high as 93% depending on the specific nation. Accuracy was lower in nations with smaller stock markets.\\n\\n\\n== Theory ==\\nBuffett acknowledged that his metric was a simple one and thus had \"limitations\", however the underlying theoretical basis for the indicator, particularly in the US, is considered reasonable.For example, studies have shown a consistent and strong annual correlation between US GDP growth, and US corporate profit growth, and which has increased materially since the Great Recession of 2007–2009. GDP captures effects where a given industry\\'s margins increase materially for a period, but the effect of reduced wages and costs, dampening margins in other industries.The same studies show a poor annual correlation between US GDP growth and US equity returns, underlining Buffett\\'s belief that when equity prices get ahead of corporate profits (via the GNP/GDP proxy), poor returns will follow.  The indicator has also been advocated for its ability to reduce the effects of \"aggressive accounting\" or \"adjusted profits\", that distort the value of corporate profits in the price–earnings ratio or EV/EBITDA ratio metrics; and that it is not affected by share buybacks (which don\\'t affect aggregate corporate profits).The Buffett indicator has been calculated for most international stock', metadata={'title': 'Buffett indicator', 'summary': 'The Buffett indicator (or the Buffett metric, or the Market capitalization-to-GDP ratio) is a valuation multiple used to assess how expensive or cheap the aggregate stock market is at a given point in time.

       " Document(page_content=\"The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, first published in 1949, is a widely acclaimed book on value investing. The book provides strategies on how to successfully use value investing in the stock market. Historically, the book has been one of the most popular books on investing and Graham's legacy remains.\\n\\n\\n== Background and history ==\\nThe Intelligent Investor is based on value investing, an investment approach Graham began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently refined with David Dodd. This sentiment was echoed by other Graham disciples such as Irving Kahn and Walter Schloss. Warren Buffett read the book at age 20 and began using the value investing taught by Graham to build his own investment portfolio.The Intelligent Investor also marks a significant deviation in stock selection from Graham's earlier works, such as Security Analysis. Which is, instead of extensive analysis on an individual company, just apply simple earning criteria and buy a group of companies. He explained the change as:\\n\\nThe thing that I have been emphasizing in my own work for the last few years has been the group approach. To try to buy groups of stocks that meet some simple criterion for being undervalued -- regardless of the industry and with very little attention to the individual company... I found the results were very good for 50 years. They certainly did twice as well as the Dow Jones. And so my enthusiasm has been transferred from the selective to the group approach. What I want is an earnings ratio twice as good as the bond interest ratio typically for most years. One can also apply a dividend criterion or an asset value criterion and get good results. My  research indicates the best results come from simple earnings criterions.\\n\\n\\n== Analysis ==\\n\\n\\n=== Value investing ===\\nGraham’s main investment approach outlined in The Intelligent Investor is that of value investing. Value investing is an investment strategy that targets undervalued stocks of companies that have the capabilities as businesses to perform well in the long run. Value investing is not concerned with short term trends in the market or daily movements of stocks. This is because value investing strategies believe the market overreacts to price changes in the short term, without taking into account a company’s fundamentals for long-term growth. In its most basic terms, value investing is based on the premise that if you know the true value of a stock, then you can save lots of money if you can buy that stock on sale.\\n\\n\\n=== Mr. Market ===\\n\\nOne of Graham's important allegories is that of Mr. Market, meant to personify the irrationality and group-think of the stock market. Mr. Market is an obliging fellow who turns up every day at the shareholder's door offering to buy or sell his shares at a different price. Often, the price quoted by Mr. Market seems plausible, but sometimes it is ridiculous. The investor is free to either agree with his quoted price and trade with him, or ignore him completely. Mr. Market doesn't mind this, and will be back the following day to quote another price.\\nThe point of this anecdote is that the investor should not regard the whims of Mr. Market as a determining factor in the value of the shares the investor owns. He should profit from market folly rather than participate in it. A common fallacy in the market is that investors are reasonable and homogenous, but Mr. Market serves to show that this is not the case. The investor is advised to concentrate on the real life performance of his companies and receiving dividends, rather than be too concerned with Mr. Market's often irrational behavior.\\n\\n\\n=== Determining value ===\\nIn The Intelligent Investor, Graham explains the importance of determining value when investing. In order to invest for value successfully and avoid participating in short-term market booms and busts, determining the value of companies is essential. To determine value, investors use fundamental analysis.

       " Document(page_content='Nebraska Furniture Mart (NFM) is a home furnishing store in North America that sells furniture, flooring, appliances and electronics. It is the largest of its kind in North America. NFM was founded in 1937 by Belarus-born Rose Blumkin, who was known as Mrs. B., in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Under the motto \"sell cheap and tell the truth,\" she worked in the business until age 103. In 1983, Mrs. B. sold a majority interest to Berkshire Hathaway on a handshake deal with Warren Buffett for $60 million.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nNebraska Furniture Mart was founded in 1937 by Rose Blumkin in Omaha, Nebraska. Blumkin borrowed the initial $500 investment from her brother while her husband Isadore continued to run their second hand clothing store. At one point early on, the Blumkins had to sell their own home furnishings to pay off a debt. Mrs. B set the Mart apart by selling products cheaper than the other furniture store around. The bigger competitors were able to successfully get the furniture suppliers to stop selling to the Mart because of the prices. Rather than give up and raise prices, Mrs. B went to other suppliers around the country while still underselling her competitors.In 1983, at age 89, Mrs. B sold 80% of Nebraska Furniture Mart to Warren Buffett in a one-page handshake deal. Buffett bought the company without auditing her inventory or books, instead basing the deal on his own shopping experience at the Mart and his respect for the Blumkin family. Mrs. B sold the business due to her belief that if she sold before her death, her children wouldn\\'t fight over the company. She continued to work at the store, putting in her normal 70-hour work week, using an electric scooter to get around. Soon after the sale, Buffett would say, “Put her up against the top graduates of the top business schools or chief executives of the Fortune 500 and, assuming an even start with the same resources, she’d run rings around them.”In 1989, at age 95, Mrs. B\\'s family forced her into retirement. Unhappy with this and realizing that Buffett had not made her sign a non-compete agreement, Mrs. B started \"Mrs. B’s Clearance and Factory Outlet\" across the street from Nebraska Furniture Mart three months later. Two years later, \"Mrs. B’s Clearance and Factory Outlet\" was profitable and the third largest carpet outlet in Omaha. The following year, Buffett purchased the new store and merged it with the Mart. In 1994, the Mart added an electronics and appliance store.In 1998, at age 104, Mrs. B died, leaving behind the nation\\'s largest home furnishings store. In 2000, Nebraska Furniture Mart bought Homemakers Furniture and opened the Mart\\'s second location in Clive, Iowa.In 2003, the Mart opened its third store in Kansas City, Kansas\\' Village West complex. The opening of the Kansas City store was initially plagued with problems for nearly two years. The store was overwhelmed by the number of customers, which also caused deliveries to lag by more than 30 days. The problems multiplied, because the initial rush of customers never let up. Because of the initial difficulty in getting the large store up and running, NFM president Ron Blumkin initially told Warren Buffett that he never had plans to open another store.By 2011, this attitude had changed, and Nebraska Furniture Mart announced their fourth and largest location, in The Colony, Texas, which is a far north suburb of Dallas. The problems with the Kansas City location opening would lead to much more long-term planning in the eventual development and opening of the Texas location. The store, called the \"Nebraska Furniture Mart of Texas\", opened in 2015.\\n\\n\\n== Locations ==\\nAs of 2020, Nebraska Furniture Mart has five store locations: two in Omaha (including a factory outlet store called \"Mrs. B\\'s Clearance Center & Factory Outlet); as well as locations in Iowa, Kansas, and Texas.\\n\\n\\n=== Omaha, Nebraska ===\\nThe Omaha, Nebraska store is over 450,000 square feet (42,000 m2) of retail space and is on 78 acres (320,0', metadata={'title': 'Nebraska Furniture Mart', 'summary': 'Nebraska Furniture Mart (NFM) is a home furnishing store in North America that sells furniture, flooring, appliances and electronics.

Mary See had developed the recipes that became the foundation of the See\\'s candy business while helping run her husband\\'s hotel on Tremont Island in Ontario.\\nThe family opened the first See\\'s Candies shop and kitchen at 135 North Western Avenue in Los Angeles in November 1921. They had twelve shops by the mid-1920s and operated thirty shops during the Great Depression. See\\'s first white and black \"all porcelain\" store was opened in Bakersfield, California on May 1, 1941.In 1936 See\\'s opened a shop in San Francisco. It moved operations to make creams and truffles (60% of product sales) to South San Francisco in order to take advantage of the location\\'s cold weather.\\nIn 1972, the See family sold the company, which generated $4 million in pre-tax profit that year, to Berkshire Hathaway for $25 million.  On January 3, 1972, Blue Chip obtained a controlling interest in See\\'s Candy Shops. Blue Chip later acquired 100% of See\\'s for an overall price of $25 million. Wesco Financial Corporation was an 80.1% owned subsidiary of Blue Chip Stamps until its complete merger into Berkshire Hathaway in 2011. Warren Buffett has called See\\'s \"the prototype of a dream business.\" (2007)  At a 1996 luncheon in San Francisco, Charlie Munger revealed that See\\'s was the first high quality business that Berkshire ever bought. Previous to that point, Berkshire had focused on undervalued assets that could be bought cheaply. The See\\'s acquisition influenced their commitment to buying businesses with a strong reputation and bran', metadata={'title': \"See's Candies\", 'summary': \"See's Candies is an American manufacturer and distributor of candy, particularly chocolates.

       " Document(page_content='Benjamin Graham (; né Grossbaum; May 9, 1894 – September 21, 1976) was a British-born American financial analyst, investor and professor. He is widely known as the \"father of value investing\", and wrote two of the discipline\\'s founding texts: Security Analysis (1934) with David Dodd, and The Intelligent Investor (1949). His investment philosophy stressed independent thinking, emotional detachment, and careful security analysis, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing the price of a stock from the value of its underlying business.\\nAfter graduating from Columbia University at age 20, Graham started his career on Wall Street, eventually founding Graham–Newman Corp., a successful mutual fund. He also taught investing for many years at Columbia Business School, where one of his students was Warren Buffett. Graham later taught at UCLA Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles.\\nGraham laid the groundwork for value investing at mutual funds, hedge funds, diversified holding companies, and other investment vehicles. He was the driving force behind the establishment of the profession of security analysis and the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. He also advocated the creation of index funds decades before they were introduced. Throughout his career, Graham had many notable disciples who went on to earn substantial success as investors, including Irving Kahn and Warren Buffett, who described Graham as the second most influential person in his life after his own father. Among other well-known investors influenced by Graham were Charles D. Ellis, Mario Gabelli, Seth Klarman, Howard Marks, John Neff and Sir John Templeton.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nGraham was born Benjamin Grossbaum in London, England, to Jewish parents. On his mother\\'s side, he was the great-grandson of Rabbi Yaakov Gesundheit and a cousin of neuroscientist Ralph Waldo Gerard. He moved to New York City with his family when he was one year old. The family changed its name from Grossbaum to Graham to assimilate into American society and avoid anti-Semitic and anti-German sentiments.After the death of his father, who owned a successful porcelain shop, and the Panic of 1907, the family fell into poverty. That experience helped shape Graham\\'s lifelong quest for investment values. Graham excelled as a student, graduating as salutatorian of his class at Columbia, finishing his studies in three-and-a-half years after entering at age 16. Before the end of his senior year, the college offered him teaching positions in three different departments: mathematics, English and philosophy. Graham chose instead to help support his widowed mother by taking a job on Wall Street, where he later ran private partnerships and, starting in 1936, the Graham-Newman fund. Early on, Graham made a name for himself with \"The Northern Pipeline Affair\", an early case of shareholder activism involving John D. Rockefeller. Graham\\'s research indicated Northern Pipeline Co. held vast cash and bond assets that he believed were not being put to good use, and bought enough shares to force a proxy vote to distribute these assets to shareholders.\\nLater, Graham patented two innovative hand-held calculators, wrote a Broadway play called \"Baby Pompadour\", and taught himself Spanish so he could translate a major Uruguayan novel, Mario Benedetti’s The Truce, into English. (By the end of his life, Graham knew at least seven languages.)\\n\\n\\n== Investment and academic career ==\\nHis first book, Security Analysis with David Dodd, was published in 1934. In Security Analysis, he proposed a clear definition of investment that was distinguished from what he deemed speculation. It read, \"An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.\"Warren Buffett describes The Intelligent Investor (1949) as \"the best book about investing ever written.\" Graham exhorted the stock ma', metadata={'title': 'Benjamin Graham', 'summary': 'Benjamin Graham (; né Grossbaum; May 9, 1894 – September 21, 1976) was a British-born American financial analyst, investor and professor.
